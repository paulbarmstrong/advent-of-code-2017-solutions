## Description

The [Advent Of Code 2017](https://adventofcode.com/2017) is a series of coding problems in the form of a calendar. Each day of the calendar contains a problem with two parts.

With this project I tackle these coding problems in a linux environment. I plan to solve each problem with Python, Java, and C/C++.

## Motivations

What I expect to gain from solving these problems in multiple languages is a better understanding of the strengths and weaknessess of each language. By developing through a linux virtual machine I will learn more about git commands, and the command line behavior of each language.
