# Advent Of Code 2017 Solutions

## Details

* Author: Paul Armstrong

* Progress: 2%

## Description

With this project I tackle the *Advent Of Code 2017* coding problems in a linux environment. I plan to solve each problem with Python, Java, and C/C++.

## Motivations

What I expect to gain from solving these problems in multiple languages is a better understanding of the strengths and weaknessess of each language. By developing through a linux virtual machine I will learn more about git commands, and the command line behavior of each language.
